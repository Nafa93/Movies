Answer and write into a Readme file the following questions
1. What does the single responsibility principle consist of? What's its purpose?

Single Responsibility is the first of the five SOLID principles, it states that every class on your program should have only one reponsibility. This keeps your code small and easy to reuse since it's much easier to compose something big with small pieces instead of having multiple big pieces with a lot of duplicated code.

2. What characteristics does, in your opinion, a “good” code or clean code have?

Good code should be as small as possible, it should be self explanatory and naming should be something really important to make everything more readable and last but not least it should be predictable
  
3. Detail how you would do everything that you have not completed.

I've done most of the things on the list but there's a lot of room for improvement. I wasn't able to dedicate as much time as I wanted to the youtube player, and I couldn't add many tests. I did a few animations on the segmented view but other transitions could be added. There's a few lines of code that are duplicated and I think the navigation layer could be improved ad well. One last thing that I would improve is adding a library like Kingfisher to handle async images since it supports caching.

The only thing that I didn't do is the offline mode, I could've done by making generic the JSON layer that I wrote to persist the watch list or using something like CoreData or Realm. I also missed the launchscreen that was on the design.
I would've added tests to all the view models if I had enough time.
